            <h2>Why Page?</h2>
            <h3>Page, The Center of the Grand Circle</h3>
            <p>
              The City of Page is one of the youngest communities in the United
              States. It is located in northeastern Arizona, approximately five
              hours north of Phoenix and five hours east of Las Vegas.The town
              began in 1957 as a housing camp for workers building the Glen
              Canyon Dam. In 1958, some 24 square miles of Navajo land were
              exchanged for a larger tract in Utah, and "Government Camp" (later
              called Page in honor of Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner John C.
              Page) was born.
            </p>
            <p>
              Page is in the center of over 40 National Parks, National
              Recreation Areas, National Monuments, and Tribal Parks. Zion,
              Bryce, the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley…the most visited and
              photographed destinations in the American Southwest encircle Page.
              North, south, east, or west…all roads lead to Page.

                  Horseshoe Bend has been featured as a landmark for Glen Canyon
                  National Recreation Area, Grand Canyon National Park, the
                  Cities of Page AZ, Kanab UT, St George UT, and the Navajo

                <p>
                  Horseshoe Bend offers incredible views with easy access. It's
                  a short, easy hike to the overlook with plenty of room to get
                  photos without other people in them. There is a fee for
                  parking! Don't forget to "Leave No Trace" and respect the
                  land.

                <h4>Monument Valley</h4>
                <p>
                  Monument Valley, a red-sand desert region on the Arizona-Utah
                  border, is known for the towering sandstone buttes of Monument
                  Valley Navajo Tribal Park. The park is accessed by the
                  looping, 17-mile Valley Drive. The famous, steeply sloped
                  Mittens buttes can be viewed from the road or from overlooks
                  such as John Ford’s Point.

                <h5>What I Like About It</h5>
                <p>
                  The 17-mile Valley Drive is bumpy, sandy, and so fun! A 4X4 is
                  definitely recommended. Any other access requires a guided
                  tour.

                <h4>Zion National Park</h4>
                <p>
                  Zion National Park is a southwest Utah nature preserve
                  distinguished by Zion Canyon’s steep red cliffs. Zion Canyon
                  Scenic Drive cuts through its main section, leading to forest
                  trails along the Virgin River. The river flows to the Emerald
                  Pools, which have waterfalls and a hanging garden.

                <p>1 Zion Park Blvd, Springdale, UT 84767</p>
                <h5>What I Like About It</h5>
                <p>
                  Zion is simply breathtaking. The cliffs tower above you and
                  surround you on all sides. Get there as early as possible.
                  Parking spots fill up fast and the shuttle becomes crowded.
                  Make sure to check out the underappreciated "The Watchman"
                  hike!

            <p>
              Hello! My name is Katie Shepard. I recently spent a week in
              Arizona. Three of those days were spent exploring Page and the
              surrounding area. I created this page as a part of a project for
              SheCodes to develop my coding skills.

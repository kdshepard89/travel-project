            <h2>Why Page?</h2>
            <h3>Page, The Center of the Grand Circle</h3>
            <p>
              The City of Page is one of the youngest communities in the United
              States. It is located in northeastern Arizona, approximately five
              hours north of Phoenix and five hours east of Las Vegas.The town
              began in 1957 as a housing camp for workers building the Glen
              Canyon Dam. In 1958, some 24 square miles of Navajo land were
              exchanged for a larger tract in Utah, and "Government Camp" (later
              called Page in honor of Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner John C.
              Page) was born.
            </p>
            <p>
              Page is in the center of over 40 National Parks, National
              Recreation Areas, National Monuments, and Tribal Parks. Zion,
              Bryce, the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley…the most visited and
              photographed destinations in the American Southwest encircle Page.
              North, south, east, or west…all roads lead to Page.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Katie Shepard. I recently spent a week in
              Arizona. Three of those days were spent exploring Page and the
              surrounding area. I created this page as a part of a project for
              SheCodes to develop my coding skills.
